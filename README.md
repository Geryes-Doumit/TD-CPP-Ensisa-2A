# C++ learning exercises

To compile and run the C++ code, you can use the shell scirpt file `compile-and-run.sh` like this :

```bash
./compile-and-run.sh <folder-path> 
# compiles all *.cpp files in the specified folder path, 
# then runs the resulting executable file

# for example :
./compile-and-run.sh TD2/Exo1-SearchAlgorithms/
# will compile and run the first exercise of the second TD.
```

or like this :

```bash
./compile-and-run.sh 
# compiles all *.cpp files in the latest folder (name-based),
# then runs the resulting executable file
```

If you cannot run the script file, make sure it has execution rights. You can do :

```bash
chmod +x compile-and-run.sh
```
